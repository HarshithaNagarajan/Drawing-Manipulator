# Drawing-Manipulator
## About
This project deals with the design of a planar robotic manipulator that can draw basic shapes such as a square or a rectangle. The manipulator is called "Mipie". The type of shape to be drawn, and its dimensions are taken as input from the user.

***Model Geometry***

## Steps to run the Manipulator
1. Download all the files present in the directory ***Code Files*** and store them locally
2. Run the ***Drawing_Manipulator.m*** file. This is present in ***Code Files*** -> ***Drawing_Manipulator.m*** 
3. On the menu that appears, choose a shape for Mipie to draw, and enter its appropriate dimensions
